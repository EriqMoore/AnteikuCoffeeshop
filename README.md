# Anteiku Coffee Shop

This is a coffee shop landing page, designed by me, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Reason For Building

To show I can build static sites with the means of going further to add more Javascript interaction if ever called upon.
I've added a reservations page to the site that incorporates a functional form also.

# Project Challenges

I ran into challenges with this project in terms of designing a layout for the page, choosing colors, choosing fonts, making a logo, etc.
Along with some minor hickups when making it mobile friendly which I overcame.
