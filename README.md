# AnteikuCoffee Shop

This is an coffee shop landing page, designed by me, bulit using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Reason For Building

To show I can build static sites with the means of going further to add more Javascript interaction if ever called upon.

# Project Challenges

I ran into challenges with this project in terms of designing a layout for the page, choosing colors, choosing fonts, making a logo, etc.
Along with some minor hickups when making it mobile friendly which I overcame.
